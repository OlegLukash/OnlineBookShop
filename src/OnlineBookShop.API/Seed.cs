It describes a scalable, easy-to-understand approach to big data systems that can be built and run by a small team. Following a realistic example, this book guides readers through the theory of big data systems, how to implement them in practice, and how to deploy and operate them once they're built.Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications.About the BookWeb-scale applications like social networks, real-time analytics, or e-commerce sites deal with a lot of data, whose volume and velocity exceed the limits of traditional database systems. These applications require architectures built around clusters of machines to store and process data of any size, or speed. Fortunately, scale and simplicity are not mutually exclusive.Big Data teaches you to build big data systems using an architecture designed specifically to capture and analyze web-scale data. This book presents the Lambda Architecture, a scalable, easy-to-understand approach that can be built and run by a small team. You'll explore the theory of big data systems and how to implement them in practice. In addition to discovering a general framework for processing big data, you'll learn specific technologies like Hadoop, Storm, and NoSQL databases.This book requires no previous exposure to large-scale data analysis or NoSQL tools. Familiarity with traditional databases is helpful.What's InsideIntroduction to big data systemsReal-time processing of web-scale dataTools like Hadoop, Cassandra, and StormExtensions to traditional database skillsAbout the AuthorsNathan Marz is the creator of Apache Storm and the originator of the Lambda Architecture for big data systems.

The Kubernetes container orchestration system safely manages the structure and flow of a distributed application, organizing containers and services for maximum efficiency. Kubernetes serves as an operating system for your clusters, eliminating the need to factor the underlying network and server infrastructure into your designs. About the Book Kubernetes in Action teaches you to use Kubernetes to deploy container-based distributed applications. You'll start with an overview of Docker and Kubernetes before building your first Kubernetes cluster. You'll gradually expand your initial application, adding features and deepening your knowledge of Kubernetes architecture and operation.

This book will help you identify the appropriate service boundaries within your business. We'll start by looking at what microservices are and their main characteristics. Moving forward, you will be introduced to real-life application scenarios; after assessing the current issues, we will begin the journey of transforming this application by splitting it into a suite of microservices using C# 7.0 with .NET Core 2.0. You will identify service boundaries, split the application into multiple microservices, and define service contracts. You will find out how to configure, deploy, and monitor microservices, and configure scaling to allow the application to quickly adapt to increased demand in the future.With an introduction to reactive microservices, you'll strategically gain further value to keep your code base simple, focusing on what is more important rather than on messy asynchronous calls.What you will learnGet acquainted with Microsoft Azure Service FabricCompare microservices with monolithic applications and SOALearn Docker and Azure API managementDefine a service interface and implement APIs using ASP.NET Core 2.0Integrate services using a synchronous approach via RESTful APIs with ASP.NET Core 2.0Implement microservices security using Azure Active Directory, OpenID Connect, and OAuth 2.0Understand the operation and scaling of microservices in .NET Core 2.0Understand the key features of reactive microservices and implement them using reactive extensionsWho This Book Is ForThis book is for .NET Core developers who want to learn and understand the microservices architecture and implement it in their .NET Core applications.
