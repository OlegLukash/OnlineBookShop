# N-Layer architecture
- Users make requests through the UI layer, which interacts only with the BLL. The BLL, in turn, can call the DAL for data access requests
- The UI layer shouldn't make any requests to the DAL directly, nor should it interact with persistence directly through other means.â€‹
- When a layer is changed or replaced, only those layers that work with it should be impacted
